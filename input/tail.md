# tail

![](../.gitbook/assets/tail.png)

The `in_tail` Input plugin allows Fluentd to read events from the tail of text files. Its behavior is similar to the `tail -F` command.

It is included in Fluentd's core.

## Example Configuration

```text
<source>
  @type tail
  path /var/log/httpd-access.log
  pos_file /var/log/td-agent/httpd-access.log.pos
  tag apache.access
  <parse>
    @type apache2
  </parse>
</source>
```

Refer to the [Configuration File](../configuration/config-file.md) article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

For `<parse>`, see [Parse Section](../configuration/parse-section.md).

### How It Works

When Fluentd is first configured with `in_tail`, it will start reading from the **tail** of that log, not the beginning. Once the log is rotated, Fluentd starts reading the new file from the beginning. It keeps track of the current inode number.

If `td-agent` restarts, it resumes reading from the last position before the restart. This position is recorded in the position file specified by the `pos_file` parameter.

### Linux Capability

Since v1.12.0, `in_tail` handles the following Linux cababilities if Fluentd's Linux capability handling module is enabled:

* `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH` \(`:dac_read_search` on `in_tail` code.\)
* `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` \(`:dac_override` on `in_tail` code.\)

## Parameters

See [Common Parameters](../configuration/plugin-common-parameters.md).

### `@type` \(required\)

The value must be `tail`.

### `tag`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| string | required parameter | 0.14.0 |

The tag of the event.

`*` can be used as a placeholder that expands to the actual file path, replacing `'/'` with `'.'`.

With the following configuration:

```text
path /path/to/file
tag foo.*
```

`in_tail` emits the parsed events with the `foo.path.to.file` tag.

### `path`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| string | required parameter | 0.14.0 |

The path\(s\) to read. Multiple paths can be specified, separated by comma `','`.

`*` and `strftime` format can be included to add/remove the watch file dynamically. At the interval of `refresh_interval`, Fluentd refreshes the list of watch files.

```text
path /path/to/%Y/%m/%d/*
```

For multiple paths:

```text
path /path/to/a/*,/path/to/b/c.log
```

If the date is `20140401`, Fluentd starts to watch the files in `/path/to/2014/04/01` directory. See also `read_from_head` parameter.

By default, You should not use `*` with log rotation because it may cause the log duplication. To avoid log duplication, you need to set `follow_inodes true` in the configuration.

### `path_timezone`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| string | nil | 1.8.1 |

This parameter is for `strftime` formatted path like `/path/to/%Y/%m/%d/`.

`in_tail` uses system timezone by default. This parameter overrides it:

```text
path_timezone "+00"
```

For timezone format, see [Timezone Section](../configuration/format-section.md#time-parameters).

### `exclude_path`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| array | `[]` \(empty\) | 0.14.0 |

The paths excluded from the watcher list.

For example, to remove the compressed files, you can use the following pattern:

```text
path /path/to/*
exclude_path ["/path/to/*.gz", "/path/to/*.zip"]
```

`exclude_path` takes input as an array, unlike `path` which takes as a string.

### `follow_inodes`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | false | 1.12.0 |

Enable combination of `*` in path with rotation inside same directory and `read_from_head true`.

```text
path /path/to/*
read_from_head true
follow_inodes true  # Without this parameter, file rotation causes log duplication.
```

### `refresh_interval`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| time | 60 \(seconds\) | 0.14.0 |

The interval to refresh the list of watch files. This is used when the path includes `*`.

### `limit_recently_modified`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| time | nil \(disabled\) | 0.14.13 |

Limits the watching files that the modification time is within the specified time range when using `*` in `path`.

### `skip_refresh_on_startup`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | false | 0.14.13 |

Skips the refresh of the watch list on startup. This reduces the startup time when `*` is used in `path`.

### `read_from_head`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | false | 0.14.0 |

Starts to read the logs from the head of the file, not tail.

If you want to `tail` the contents with `*` or `strftime` dynamic path, set this parameter to `true`. Instead, you should guarantee that the log rotation will not occur in `*` directory. Since v1.12.0, you can use `follow_inodes true` to avoid log duplication by log rotation.

When this is `true`, `in_tail` tries to read a file during the startup phase. If the target file is large, it takes a long time and other plugins do not start until the reading is finished.

### `encoding`, `from_encoding`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| string | nil \(string encoding is `ASCII-8BIT`\) | 0.14.0 |

Specifies the encoding of reading lines.

By default, `in_tail` emits string value as ASCII-8BIT encoding.

These options change it:

* If `encoding` is specified, `in_tail` changes string to `encoding`.

  This uses Ruby's [`String#force_encoding`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/trunk/String.html#method-i-force_encoding).

* If `encoding` and `from_encoding` both are specified, `in_tail` tries to

  encode string from `from_encoding` to `encoding`. This uses Ruby's

  [`String#encode`](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/trunk/String.html#method-i-encode).

You can get the list of supported encodings with this command:

```text
$ ruby -e 'p Encoding.name_list.sort'
```

### `read_lines_limit`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| integer | 1000 | 0.14.0 |

The number of lines to read with each I/O operation.

If you see `chunk bytes limit exceeds for an emitted event stream` or similar log with `in_tail`, set a smaller value.

### `read_bytes_limit_per_second`

| type    | default        | version |
|:--------|:---------------|:--------|
| size    | -1 (unlimited) | 1.12.0  |

The number of reading bytes per second to read with I/O operation.

If you work with a big cluster with high volume of log, you can use this parameter
to avoid network saturation and make it easier to calculate the max throughput per node.
This option is useful. To restrict shipping log volumes per second, set a positive number.

### `multiline_flush_interval`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| time | nil \(disabled\) | 0.14.0 |

The interval of flushing the buffer for multiline format.

If you set `multiline_flush_interval 5s`, `in_tail` flushes buffered event after 5 seconds from last emit. This option is useful when you use `format_firstline` option.

### `pos_file` \(highly recommended\)

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| string | nil | 0.14.0 |

Fluentd will record the position it last read from this file:

```text
pos_file /var/log/td-agent/tmp/access.log.pos
```

`pos_file` handles multiple positions in one file so no need to have multiple `pos_file` parameters per `source`.

Don't share `pos_file` between `in_tail` configurations. It causes unexpected behavior e.g. corrupt `pos_file` content.

`in_tail` removes the untracked file position at startup. It means that the content of `pos_file` keeps growing until a restart when you tails lots of files with the dynamic path setting.

This [issue](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/1126) will be fixed in future.

### `pos_file_compaction_interval`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| time | nil | 1.9.2 |

The interval of doing compaction of pos file.

The targets of compaction are unwatched, unparsable, and the duplicated line. You can use this value when `pos_file` option is set:

```text
pos_file /var/log/td-agent/tmp/access.log.pos
pos_file_compaction_interval 72h
```

### `<parse>` Directive \(required\)

The format of the log.

`in_tail` uses the parser plugin to parse the log. See [`parser`](../parser/) for more detail.

Examples:

```text
# json
<parse>
  @type json
</parse>

# regexp
<parse>
  @type regexp
  expression ^(?<name>[^ ]*) (?<user>[^ ]*) (?<age>\d*)$
</parse>
```

If `@type` contains `multiline`, `in_tail` works in multiline mode.

### `format`

Deprecated parameter. Use `<parse>` instead.

### `path_key`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| string | nil \(no assign\) | 0.14.0 |

Adds the watching file path to the `path_key` field.

With this configuration:

```text
path /path/to/access.log
path_key tailed_path
```

The generated events are like this:

```text
{"tailed_path":"/path/to/access.log","k1":"v1",...,"kN":"vN"}
```

### `rotate_wait`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| time | 5 \(seconds\) | 0.14.0 |

`in_tail` actually does a bit more than `tail -F` itself. When rotating a file, some data may still need to be written to the old file as opposed to the new one.

`in_tail` takes care of this by keeping a reference to the old file \(even after it has been rotated\) for some time before transitioning completely to the new file. This helps prevent data designated for the old file from getting lost. By default, this time interval is 5 seconds.

The `rotate_wait` parameter accepts a single integer representing the number of seconds you want this time interval to be.

### `enable_watch_timer`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | true | 0.14.0 |

Enables the additional watch timer. Setting this parameter to `false` will significantly reduce CPU and I/O consumption when tailing a large number of files on systems with `inotify` support. The default is `true` which results in an additional 1 second timer being used.

`in_tail` \(via `Cool.io`\) uses `inotify` on systems which support it. Earlier versions of `libev` on some platforms \(e.g. MacOS X\) did not work properly; therefore, an explicit 1 second timer was used. Even on systems with `inotify` support, this results in additional I/O each second, for every file being tailed.

Early testing demonstrates that modern `Cool.io` and `in_tail` work properly without the additional watch timer. In the future, depending on the feedback and testing, the additional watch timer may be disabled by default.

### `enable_stat_watcher`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | true | 1.0.1 |

Enables the additional `inotify`-based watcher. Setting this parameter to `false` will disable the `inotify` events and use only timer watcher for file tailing.

This option is mainly for avoiding the stuck issue with `inotify`.

### `open_on_every_update`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | false | 0.14.12 |

Opens and closes the file on every update instead of leaving it open until it gets rotated.

### `emit_unmatched_lines`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | false | 0.14.12 |

Emits unmatched lines when `<parse>` format is not matched for incoming logs.

Emitted record is `{"unmatched_line" : incoming line}`, e.g. `{"unmatched_line" : "Non JSON format!"}`.

### `ignore_repeated_permission_error`

| type | default | version |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| bool | false | 0.14.0 |

If you have to exclude the non-permission files from the watch list, set this parameter to `true`. It suppresses the repeated permission error logs.

#### `@log_level`

The `@log_level` option allows the user to set different levels of logging for each plugin. The supported log levels are: `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, and `trace`.

Refer to the [Logging](../deployment/logging.md) for more details.

## FAQ

### What happens when `<parse>` type is not matched for logs?

`in_tail` prints warning message. For example, if you specify `@type json` in `<parse>` and your log line is `123,456,str,true`, then you will see following message in fluentd logs:

```text
2018-04-19 02:23:44 +0900 [warn]: #0 pattern not match: "123,456,str,true"
```

See also `emit_unmatched_lines` parameter.

### `in_tail` doesn't start to read the log file, why?

`in_tail` follows `tail -F` command's behavior by default, so `in_tail` reads only the new logs. If you want to read the existing lines for the batch use case, set `read_from_head true`.

### `in_tail` shows `/path/to/file unreadable` log message. Why?

If you see this message:

> `/path/to/file` unreadable. It is excluded and would be examined next time.

It means that `fluentd` does not have read permission for `/path/to/file`. Check your fluentd and target files permission.

### `logrotate` Setting

`logrotate` has the `nocreate` parameter and it does not create a new file if log rotation is triggered. It means `in_tail` cannot find the new file to tail.

This parameter does not fit the typical application log use cases, so check your `logrotate` setting which does not include the `nocreate` parameter.

### What happens when `in_tail` receives `BufferOverflowError`?

`in_tail` stops reading the new lines and pos file updates until `BufferOverflowError` is resolved. After resolving `BufferOverflowError`, resume emitting new lines and pos file updates.

### `in_tail` is sometimes stopped when monitor lots of files. How to avoid it?

Try to set `enable_stat_watcher false` in `in_tail` setting. We got several reports that `in_tail` is stopped when `*` is included in `path`, and the problem is resolved by disabling the `inotify` events.

### Wildcard pattern in `path` does not work on Windows, why?

The backslash \(`\`\) with `*` does not work on Windows by internal limitations. To avoid this, use slash style instead:

```text
# good
path C:/path/to/*/foo.log

# bad
path C:\\path\\to\\*\\foo.log
```
